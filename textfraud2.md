1. Using text data
Let's talk about how you can incorporate text data in your fraud analysis.

2. You will often encounter text data during fraud detection
During fraud analysis, almost always, there will be some sort of textual data available that you can use to your advantage. It can be emails between the company and its clients, or emails within the company. Descriptions of bank transactions are a good example also. It can be that a client service team leaves notes on a client account. Insurance claims are full of textual data, and it may even be the case that there are recorded telephone conversations. And this list goes on. It is, therefore, important to know how to handle textual data, when working on fraud detection problems.

3. Text mining techniques for fraud detection
When using text data in fraud analysis, there are multiple ways to use the data. A common application is a word search, to flag any data mentioning certain terms. Sentiment analysis, aka measuring how positive or negative a text is, can be another interesting application, which you could also combine with a word search. More straightforward, you can check whether text data associated with fraud tends to be more positive or negative, relative to the normal text. Topic analysis and counting the frequency of certain words of interest, is another powerful application for fraud detection. Let's talk about this in more detail later. A last way to use text data is to analyze the style of fraud data and search for text that is similar in style to flag for fraud.

4. Word search for fraud detection
Suppose you want to flag all client transactions that mention a certain gambling company, as this company has received bad press lately. A simple word search on all transactions and client emails can easily filter whether any of your clients mention this company. You can then either use these results as a filter, or a flag on its own, or simply as an additional feature in your machine learning model. You can do all this with a few simple lines of code. Let's have a look at how it's done.

5. Word counts to flag fraud with pandas
Pandas has functions that allow you to do operations on text data within a pandas series or DataFrame. In this example, I use the string-dot-contains function to find all rows that contain the words money laundering. You can very easily use this command to select the rows that contain these words in your DataFrame. You need to use na equals False to ignore all rows containing missing values, otherwise the indexer won't work. Suppose you want to filter on a list of words, rather than just one. This is also easily done, by the using string contains function. You need to join the list of words with the or command, so you search on whether the text contains this or that word. From then on it is easy to create a flag for data that contain these words. By using the NumPy where function, you can simply create a new variable that flags one where the condition is met, and zero otherwise.
